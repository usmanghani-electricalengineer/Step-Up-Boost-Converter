# Step-Up-Boost-Converter
This project involves the design and implementation of a Boost Converter, a DC-to-DC step-up circuit that increases the input voltage level. The system efficiently converts a 12V DC input into an 18V DC output, demonstrating the principle of voltage boosting using inductor energy storage and controlled switching.
